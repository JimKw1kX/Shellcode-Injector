# Shellcode-Injector

This injector uses [QueueUserAPC function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-queueuserapc), to inject shellcode in to a system process, this injector currently injecting into `calc.exe` calculator but user can change any process they want. User should use a convertor such as [GadgetToJScript](https://github.com/med0x2e/GadgetToJScript/tree/master), to convert to VBA or JS etc formats then execute to bypass detections. User may also need to tweak APIs to bypass detection depends on the detection mechanism.
